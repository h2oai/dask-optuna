Dask-Optuna helps improve integration between [Optuna](https://optuna.org/) and [Dask](https://dask.org/).

ðŸš¨ðŸš¨This project is actively being developed and is not yet ready for general use. Please do not use it. ðŸš¨ðŸš¨

## Example

```python
import optuna
import dask.distributed
import dask_optuna

def objective(trial):
    x = trial.suggest_uniform("x", -10, 10)
    return (x - 2) ** 2

with dask.distributed.Client() as client:
    # Create a study using Dask-compatible storage
    study = optuna.create_study(storage=dask_optuna.DaskStorage())
    # Optimize in parallel on your Dask cluster
    dask_optuna.optimize(study, objective, n_trials=100, batch_size=10)
    print(f"best_params = {study.best_params}")
```

## Background

### Current Status

Internally, Optuna uses [Joblib](https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to support running optimizations in parallel.
Because Joblib has a Dask backend, you can seamlessly have Joblib execute tasks on a
Dask cluster by placing your Optuna code in a `joblib.parallel_backend('dask')` context manager:

```python
import optuna
from dask.distributed import Client
import joblib

client = Client(...)
with joblib.parallel_backend('dask'):
    # Your optuna code here
```

This works very well for several use case.

### Pain Points

However, there are pain points when it comes to using Optuna and Dask together today. In particular:

- Optuna's `InMemory` storage doesnâ€™t support running optimization trials across multiple processes
  (https://github.com/optuna/optuna/issues/1232)
- Persistent storage (e.g. a sqlite database) is difficult to set up for a Dask cluster using remote workers,
  which may not have access to the same filesystem the cluster scheduler or client uses.
- ...

**Dask-Optuna helps address these pain points to improve scaling Optuna using Dask**

### Community discussion

Improving integration between Dask and Optuna has been discussed in both the
[Dask issue tracker](https://github.com/dask/dask/issues/6571) and
[Optuna issue tracker](https://github.com/optuna/optuna/issues/1766). Please feel free to join these discussions
if you'd like to get involved.
